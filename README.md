# TBD Demo

The Autoura.me service holds consumer hospitality & travel preferences. 

You can use DIDs to:

* Request these consumers preferences
* Request consumers current location
* Send and receive DIDComm messages

This example code uses [TBD](https://developer.tbd.website) DIDs.

If you are not quite sure what a DID is and how you can use them, or what this demo is demonstrating, [read the Autoura introduction](https://www.autoura.com/docs/api/profiles)

### How to use

Once you have this running (locally)

1. Tap button to create DID
2. Go to any of the services in the top menu 
3. If you have selected preferences, tap the button to call preferences service. 1 second later the preferences will appear on the screen
